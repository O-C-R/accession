Please! We are looking for more coders to help out... Just press *Fork* at the top of this github page and get started, or follow the instructions below... 

#### Development Setup
--------
1. Download and install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) The easiest way to do this is to just install [node](http://nodejs.org/). 
2. [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this library. 

  a. First, login to github and fork the project

  b. Then, from a terminal/shell: 
  
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS.git
  ```
3. Now navigate into the project folder and install dependencies via npm. 

  ```bash
  $ cd RiTaJS; npm install
  ```
4. To create the library from src, use gulp.

  ```bash
  $ gulp build
  ```
5. Run non-graphical tests in node with gulp.

  ```bash
  $ gulp test.node
  ```
6. Run all tests (in phantomJS) with gulp.

  ```bash
  $ gulp test
  ```
7. Work on an existing [issue](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTa/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ARiTaJS), then [submit a pull request...](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
